Luminance noise, which presents as random variations in pixel illumination, is easier to forgive, whereas chroma noise, which presents as random variations in pixel colour, is an unsightly distraction.\\n\\n<img align=\\"left\\" className=\\"with-margin\\" src={Noise} alt=\\"A noisy image\\" />\\n\\nRecent advancements in image sensor technology mean that noise is less of an issue than it was say a decade ago, but image noise will still be noticeable when shooting at higher ISO values and can be particularly problematic for smaller image sensors that gather smaller quantities of light such as 1-inch, Micro Four Thirds and APS-C sensors.\\n\\nUntil recently, noise reduction algorithms have been fairly rudimentary, often resulting in a noticeable loss of detail as the image details are \'smoothed out\' to hide the noise.\\nThis changed with the release of [DxO PhotoLab](https://www.dxo.com/dxo-photolab/)\'s DeepPRIME noise reduction algorithm. The exact inner workings of DxO\'s proprietary algorithm have not been disclosed by the company, however we know that\\nPhotoLab employs Artificial Intelligence in the form of a neural network that has been trained to perform the [demosaicing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demosaicing) and denoising processes.\\n\\nIn any case, the results speak for themselves. Below is a 100% crop of a raw image taken of a Christmas elf figure in low-light conditions at ISO 1250 using my Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark II, paired with the Olympus 25mm f1.2 PRO lens.\\nIf it is not already clear, the left side is the image processed without noise reduction and the right side is the image processed with PhotoLab\'s DeepPRIME noise reduction (v5.5).\\n\\n<ReactCompareSlider\\n  itemOne={<ReactCompareSliderImage src={ImageOne} alt=\\"Before noise reduction (100% crop)\\" />}\\n  itemTwo={<ReactCompareSliderImage src={ImageTwo} alt=\\"After noise reduction (100% crop)\\" />}\\n  className=\\"with-margin\\"\\n/>\\n\\nA further enlargement of the same crop follows:\\n\\n<ReactCompareSlider\\n  itemOne={<ReactCompareSliderImage src={ImageOneZoomed} alt=\\"Before noise reduction (200% crop)\\" />}\\n  itemTwo={<ReactCompareSliderImage src={ImageTwoZoomed} alt=\\"After noise reduction (200% crop)\\" />}\\n  className=\\"with-margin\\"\\n/>\\n\\n\\nThe reduction in noise is significant, all without any obvious loss of image detail. DeepPRIME noise reduction has been a game-changer for my Micro Four Thirds photography and I look forward to seeing what further enhnacements\\nthe team at DxO Labs can make."},{"id":"/2023/01/15/detecting-regression-commits-using-git-bisect","metadata":{"permalink":"/2023/01/15/detecting-regression-commits-using-git-bisect","source":"@site/blog/2023/01-15-detecting-regression-commits-using-git-bisect/index.mdx","title":"Detecting Regression Commits Using git bisect","description":"Locating the commit that introduced a regression, or some undesirable change, in a codebase can be difficult.

Locating the same in a frequently-changing codebase with a large number of contributors is harder again.\\n\\nFortunately [`git bisect`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect) provides a helpful tool for doing precisely this. Rather than performing a linear search of the commits, `git bisect` uses a clever binary search algorithm to locate the offending commit far more efficiently.\\n\\n<div class=\\"center with-margin\\">\\n  <VisualisationSvg className={styles.bisect} />\\n</div>\\n\\nHaving identified a commit from the past where the regression did not exist (e.g. `git checkout` a commit from say a month ago), my typical usage of `git bisect` is along the lines of:\\n\\n1. Check out the branch containing the regression and run `git bisect start`.\\n2. Label the good and bad commits: `git bisect good <commit hash>` and `git bisect bad <commit hash>`. The current commit is taken if the commit hash argument is omitted.\\n3. Bisecting commences \u2014 a candidate commit is automatically checked out and the number of revisions left to test and number of remaining steps are printed.  You can run `git bisect reset` to abort at any stage.\\n4. Check whether the regression still exists, whether this involves running an automated test or taking manual replication steps. If the candidate commit contains the regression, run `git bisect bad`, otherwise run `git bisect good`. If any search area remains, another candidate commit is automatically checked out.\\n5. Repeat #4 until the bisecting process concludes and the bad commit\'s hash is listed.\\n\\nGiven `git bisect`\'s binary search technique, the number of steps required will only increase logarithmically as the number of commits increases \u2014 this is a time-saving tool that I turn to again and again."}]}')}}]);
