<p><em>“Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.”</em></p>
<p>— A quote attributed to Greek mathematician and physicist, Archimedes.</p>
</blockquote>
<img align="left" src="/assets/images/archimedes-lever-7422d72f6bbd7d6ac6968413ac314068.jpg" alt="Archimedes lifting the world">
<p><em>Image credit <sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1-7f8780" id="user-content-fnref-1-7f8780" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></em></p>
<p>I vividly recall my early days of programming: the dopamine hits after seeing my code successfully compile and my program run;
the thing that I imagined suddenly coming to life on screen. Programming was difficult and knowledge hard-won, perhaps due to my
skill level at the time and the fact that documentation and guidance were not so readily available.</p>
<p>These were the days of 56k dial-up, GeoCities and Quake III Arena. Websites were individually-crafted and online communities were
mostly decentralised. Programming knowledge was dispersed across small and dedicated websites and communities. Then came the rapid
proliferation of open-source software and Stack Overflow&#x27;s arrival, which changed the scene again, centralising programming
discussions, better disseminating knowledge and example code.</p>
<p>The world looks very different now and the landscape is shifting dramatically once more. A pivotal moment arrived in 2022 with the
release of <a href="https://chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChatGPT</a>, the generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot from OpenAI, which is based on their Generative Pre-trained
Transformer (GPT) Large Language Model (LLM).</p>
<p>While the initial implications might have been hazy, with each subsequent advancement, the power of LLMs and their place in our
future is becoming clearer.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cognitive-bias-and-the-creative-identity-crisis">Cognitive bias and the creative identity crisis<a href="#cognitive-bias-and-the-creative-identity-crisis" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cognitive bias and the creative identity crisis" title="Direct link to Cognitive bias and the creative identity crisis">​</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;AI effect&quot;</a> describes how, once AI researchers accomplish a task previously considered indicative
of true AI—such as defeating a human at chess—the definition of genuine AI shifts, often relegating the achievement to mere
logic or mathematics.</p>
<p>I think part of this stems from a potential creative identity crisis and a tendency to want to hold onto skills that feel uniquely ours.
Imagine you&#x27;ve spent your life mastering a craft or some creative art: a studio photographer, a professional song composer, a podcaster, or a writer.
Generative AI can create incredible photos, incorporating subjects (products, people, etc.) and beautiful, lifelike videos, resulting in AI-generated
adverts and fairly convincing movies (see <a href="https://vimeo.com/1047370252" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kitsune</a>). It can create music of all different styles, write academic literature
reviews, poetry and stories. It can create convincing podcasts with multiple hosts who sound <em>real</em> and discuss source materials of your choice (like this
article, see above).</p>
<p>“AI slop”, you say? Perhaps sometimes but the power and quality of generative AI is advancing quickly, to the point where it is a challenge
to keep up, and we are still working out how to make best use of it. Progress is set to continue given the incredible competition
between the key players, like OpenAI, Google and Anthropic, and we&#x27;re no longer rendering human hands that look like spaghetti and
with too many fingers.</p>
<p>A common argument is that LLMs are just a statistical model, predicting the token that is most likely to follow the previous
tokens, over and over. Behind the glossy chat interface, the main ChatGPT API method is called Chat Completions (e.g. <code>POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions</code>), which has connotations of predictive text completion more than real intelligence.
This is true but misses the point and does not diminish the LLM’s utility.</p>
<p>In fact, the brain and LLMs work in somewhat similar ways, both by forming connections. In our brains, it is neurons communicating
and adapting based on learning and experience. In LLMs, it is a vast number of parameters that are adjusted during training, based
on huge amounts of data. When we prompt an LLM, we traverse these connections, like the sparks of electrical activity that dance
across our brain&#x27;s neurons.</p>
<p>As humans, we can dream up amazing innovations and novel ideas with <em>true soul</em>, but how much of what we produce is truly original or
innovative? Many songs are composed of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chord_progressions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">same key chord progressions</a> and only occasionally do we hear a song that truly stands out.
Film scripts often repeat the same tried and tested storylines. Taking these &quot;building blocks&quot;, whether these are notes or audio
frequencies that form melodies, pixels that form images, words and characters that form source code or a natural language, and
knowing how to arrange them to achieve a particular goal or effect is what matters. And that is what generative AI seeks to do.</p>
<p>Consider a remote worker whose thoughts, feelings, actions, keystrokes and video stream are ultimately reduced into bits and bytes
that fire over a fibre-optic cable. Operating in a digital world, we ultimately become masters of arranging bits and bytes through
multiple layers of abstraction - perhaps we are not so different to LLMs after all.</p>
<p>We need to remain mindful of these cognitive biases, emotional responses and fallacies when approaching new developments in the
field of AI, otherwise we risk throwing the baby out with the bathwater and overlooking or misunderstanding an incredibly useful technology.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="llms-and-software-engineers">LLMs and software engineers<a href="#llms-and-software-engineers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to LLMs and software engineers" title="Direct link to LLMs and software engineers">​</a></h2>
<p>It turns out LLMs can write code and they are reasonably good at it, when provided the right prompt and context. If your role is
to take on small and very well defined tickets and simply “translate” these into small code changes, then your job is ripe for
disruption.</p>
<p>If we feed an LLM a prompt with the relevant context—parts of or all of the codebase—and clear instructions like:
<em>“Add a new ‘birth_date’ database column to the ‘users’ table of the Date type, which is nullable and has no index”</em>, then our
LLM-driven agent will probably produce the correct result and will even raise a pull request.</p>
<p>I notice a general trend of pessimism in online communities, particularly LinkedIn and X (Twitter), where we are told by
influencers, not engineers, that this is the end of programming and software engineering. These comments tend to attract
a lot of attention and clicks, devolve into arguments and generate a lot of circular discussion and noise, which is probably
their intended purpose. I have a different and more optimistic take.</p>
<p>Much like the cranking of Archimedes&#x27; imaginary lever, LLMs let us amplify human effort to produce superhuman results and for
everyone, and especially software engineers, this is an incredible time to be alive.</p>
<p>As software engineers, we already had great leverage. We can create and deploy an application or service and affect millions or
billions of users, creating huge value for businesses and individuals and potentially changing the world. Armed with an LLM,
individual software engineers and teams can now move even faster. Even better, and much as I enjoy software development, we can offload
much of the drudgery and tedious work that we battle and that takes our focus away from what really matters. Maintenance work
like fixing breaking API changes after a package upgrade might fall entirely to an LLM-based agent, and we can focus on the more
exciting, novel and meaningful work.</p>
<p>There has also never been a better time to start a side hustle. The LLM will empower software engineers to start one-person
companies and exceptional engineers will now produce even more exceptional results. Some of these companies will disrupt the
slow-moving incumbent companies, operating with leaner teams and tighter margins, increasing competition all around.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="renewing-our-focus">Renewing our focus<a href="#renewing-our-focus" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Renewing our focus" title="Direct link to Renewing our focus">​</a></h2>
<p>With one bottleneck reduced—the gap between the concepts and design in our minds and the resulting source code on our
screens—we must shift our focus to the other skills and the remaining bottlenecks, including: soft skills, collaboration and leadership,
deep technical understanding across the stack, proficiency in multiple programming languages and paradigms, prototyping, testing and test
automation, creativity and innovation, critical thinking and problem solving, product and systems thinking, debugging,
optimisation, data management and analysis. And we are fortunate that LLMs can support us with these areas too.</p>
<p>For engineers, LLMs are an amplifier and multiplier. They are a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250212011320/https://signalvnoise.com/svn3/provide-sharp-knives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;sharp knife&quot;</a>, perhaps the sharpest of all, and we can achieve
so much with them, but we must be careful not to cut our fingers. Engineering fundamentals matter now more than ever.</p>
<p>Systems design and software architecture mattered before but it now matters more because poor architecture will now sooner lead to bloat,
duplication, complexity and poor performance. Thorough and constructive peer reviews mattered before but now matter more,
especially if we are moving at a faster pace and changing or adding more lines of code. An awareness of security vulnerabilities
always mattered but now matters more as we move to more rapidly ship new features, relying on code that might not have been
written entirely by humans.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="llms-replacing-software-engineers">LLMs replacing software engineers<a href="#llms-replacing-software-engineers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to LLMs replacing software engineers" title="Direct link to LLMs replacing software engineers">​</a></h2>
<p>In an <a href="https://youtu.be/7k1ehaE0bdU?si=BcKXwkmJC2E4dqw-&amp;t=7697" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Joe Rogan</a>, Mark Zuckerberg of Meta recently stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Probably in 2025, we at Meta […] are going to have an AI that can effectively be a sort of mid-level engineer that you have at your
company, that can write code.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although apparently controversial, Zuckerberg&#x27;s comment is similar to my point above regarding the translation of a small and well
defined Jira task into code changes. He does not actually state that engineers will be replaced with agents, even if some find
that idea attractive. LLM-based agents lack autonomy and agency and require direction and supervision. Let us not forget that
writing a detailed prompt to produce source code is still programming of a sort, albeit at a higher level of abstraction. Churning
out code isn&#x27;t enough - we still need the right code and it is up to us to decide what constitutes right.
Zuckerberg added, &quot;I think [it] will augment the people working on it&quot;.</p>
<p>In my opinion, LLMs will not replace software engineers on the whole, but will give existing software engineers far greater
leverage. A much longer lever to produce greater torque at the fulcrum, if you like, greatly amplifying the initial inputs.</p>
<p>There is a caveat though. I suspect that LLMs will form a component of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) or at least a
stepping stone towards it, assuming AGI can indeed be created. If AGI arrives, then <em>all bets are off</em> and we enter an entirely
new paradigm. In this future, no job is safe from disruption. With robotics, even physical, hands-on jobs are liable to be automated.
There is a possible future where a robot lays bricks, crawls around in your attic space and rewires your home. I digress.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="two-types-of-companies">Two types of companies<a href="#two-types-of-companies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Two types of companies" title="Direct link to Two types of companies">​</a></h3>
<p>There will be two types of companies. The first type will be those that see software development simply as an overhead. They are not
seeking meaningful growth or to push the boundaries, and are therefore able to now achieve the same output with fewer engineers.
Assuming <code>profit = total revenue - total expenses</code>, then reducing engineering headcount expenses will in turn increase profit, satisfying
the short-term mindset.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the second type of company will leverage LLMs to significantly multiply their engineers&#x27; output, using the
productivity boost to out-manoeuvre the competition, building better products and features, and many more of them. In the medium to
long term, these companies will run rings around the first type of company.</p>
<p>For software engineers, some turbulence lies ahead as companies begin to experiment with and adapt to LLMs, and we see the
tension between the two types of companies that I described above play out. Jobs will be lost, others will change and new jobs
will be created. With the help of LLMs, some displaced engineers who would never have considered starting their own businesses
will leave established companies to do just that.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up<a href="#wrapping-up" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Wrapping up" title="Direct link to Wrapping up">​</a></h2>
<p>Overall, I remain extremely optimistic about software engineering. Software is continuing to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250410012411/https://a16z.com/why-software-is-eating-the-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;eat the world&quot;</a> and there is no sign of
this stopping. Software will one day be everywhere and in every thing and will be more critical to our lives, and we will need people
who can build, understand, debug and maintain software. This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jevons paradox</a> in action. As software becomes
easier to build, we will probably want more of it and more people to develop and manage it.</p>
<p>In fact, there is already plenty of work ahead - almost all of our existing software and its interfaces are built on the fundamental
assumption that computers require imperative instructions, but that is no longer the case. We can talk to computers and they can
talk back. We have the huge opportunity to build new systems, experiences and products using AI as a foundation. Similar
opportunities appeared during the smartphone revolution, which literally put powerful computers in people&#x27;s pockets - we had to
rethink the assumption that computers stayed at home and rebuild accordingly. Those that adapted and took advantage of
these opportunities were ultimately the winners. Let&#x27;s get to work.</p>
